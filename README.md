# SafeCast ‚Äì Decentralized, Private, and Resilient Information Broadcast Tool

## üéØ Combined Track Submission: Privacy Infrastructure + Resilient Activist Technology

SafeCast combines **Tor Privacy Infrastructure** and **Resilient Activist Technology** tracks to create a censorship-resistant broadcast system for activists and communities.

## Concept
A Web3-powered broadcast system for activists to share messages, updates, or warnings securely ‚Äî resistant to censorship and metadata tracking. SafeCast enables resilient communication that works even when traditional web access is blocked.

## üõ°Ô∏è Track 1: Privacy Infrastructure (Tor + Web3)
- **Tor Integration**: Private RPC submissions for censorship resistance
- **Waku Messaging**: Encrypted peer-to-peer message relaying
- **Ethereum Contracts**: Message hash anchoring for authenticity
- **IPFS/Arweave**: Resilient decentralized storage
- **Privacy-First Design**: No metadata tracking, anonymous communication

## üöÄ Track 2: Resilient Activist Technology
- **Activist-Focused**: Specifically designed for activists and communities
- **Censorship Resistance**: Works offline-first, survives network restrictions
- **Resilient Storage**: Messages persist on decentralized networks
- **Real-world Use**: Broadcast warnings, updates, critical information
- **Usability**: Telegram-like interface for non-technical users

## Why It Fits Both Tracks

### Privacy Infrastructure
Messages are relayed via Waku or Tor-mixnet nodes with encrypted payloads, ensuring no metadata leakage while maintaining Web3 authenticity.

### Activist Resilience
Works even if traditional web access is blocked; messages stored on IPFS/Arweave with content hash anchors on Ethereum, ensuring resilience even when traditional web access is blocked.

### Technical Stack
- Waku (for encrypted peer-to-peer message relaying)
- Tor for private RPC + message submission
- Ethereum contract anchoring message hashes for authenticity
- Optional incentive model using tokenized relayers (private RPC or Waku nodes)

### Judging Strength
- **Privacy Strength**: End-to-end encryption, no metadata leaks
- **Technical Feasibility**: Waku + Tor + Ethereum integration
- **Usability**: Telegram-like minimal UI for community broadcast
- **Resilience**: Works offline-first + censorship-resistant
- **Creativity**: Novel combination of P2P messaging + blockchain verification

## Deliverables
